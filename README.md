In this project, I created and optimized a Binary Search Tree (BST) using Python. The aim was to build a reliable data structure for efficient data management and retrieval. I started by designing a Node class to represent each element in the tree, and a BinaryTree class to handle the overall structure and operations. 

Key operations included adding nodes, searching for specific values, finding the minimum and maximum values, deleting nodes, calculating the tree's height, and performing an inorder traversal to list the values in sorted order. I made sure to maintain the BST properties to keep the tree organized and efficient. 

For node addition, I implemented a method that places each new node in the correct position. The search function quickly finds a value by leveraging the tree's structure. The methods for finding the minimum and maximum values help with various applications, like balancing the tree. The deletion method handles nodes with different numbers of children, ensuring the tree remains balanced. 

I also wrote a function to calculate the tree's height, giving insights into its efficiency. The inorder traversal method retrieves the tree's values in a sorted list. By using recursive methods and testing the tree with different inputs, I ensured the BST worked efficiently in various scenarios. 

This project improved my understanding of binary search trees and enhanced my skills in algorithm design, data structures, and Python programming.
